            &lt;p&gt;Roger Meddows Taylor (born 26 July 1949) is an English
            musician, singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, best known
            as the drummer for the rock band Queen. As a drummer, Taylor was
            recognised early in his career for his unique sound. He was voted by
            radio listeners as the eighth-greatest drummer in classic rock music
            history in a poll conducted by Planet Rock in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As a songwriter, Taylor contributed songs to Queen&#39;s
            albums from the very beginning, composing at least one track on
            every album, and often singing lead vocals on his own compositions.
            He wrote or co-wrote three UK number 1s (&quot;These Are the Days of
            Our Lives&quot;, &quot;Innuendo&quot; and &quot;Under
            Pressure&quot;) and contributed a further five major hits
            (&quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;, &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, &quot;Heaven
            for Everyone&quot;, &quot;Breakthru&quot;, and &quot;The Invisible
            Man&quot;). He is also commonly known to have been the main writer
            on the international top-ten hit &quot;One Vision&quot;, although
            the track is credited to the whole band. He has collaborated with
            such artists as Eric Clapton, Roger Waters, Roger Daltrey, Robert
            Plant, Phil Collins, Genesis, Jimmy Nail, Elton John, Gary Numan,
            Shakin&#39; Stevens, Foo Fighters, Al Stewart, Steve Vai, Yoshiki,
            Cyndi Almouzni, and Bon Jovi. As a producer, he has produced albums
            by Virginia Wolf, Jimmy Nail and Magnum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
            addition to his drum work, Taylor sometimes played keyboards,
            guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to
            his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as the Cross,
            in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the
            early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show
            Pop Quiz, hosted by Mike Read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Source: &lt;a
